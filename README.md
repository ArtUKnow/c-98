Welcome to **C-98**, a repository dedicated to my journey in mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using C++. This collection of projects and exercises aims to demonstrate my understanding and application of core OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning resource for anyone interested in honing their C++ OOP skills. Each project is designed to tackle specific aspects of OOP, providing clear examples and explanations to help you understand the underlying principles.

## Features

- **Modular Code**: Emphasis on writing clean, modular, and reusable code.
- **Detailed Documentation**: In-depth comments and documentation to explain the logic and design choices.
- **Real-World Examples**: Projects that mimic real-world scenarios to enhance practical understanding.
- **Testing**: Integration of unit tests to ensure code reliability and correctness.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you'll find in this repository:

1. **Basic Classes and Objects**: Introduction to defining and using classes and objects.
2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Exploring the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism.
3. **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Demonstrating the principles of encapsulation and abstraction.
4. **Advanced Topics**: Diving into more complex topics like templates, exception handling, and smart pointers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArtUKnow/C-98.git
   cd C-98
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).

3. **Build and Run**:
   Navigate to the project directory and use the provided Makefile or build script to compile and run the projects.
